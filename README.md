# AnnaK-ecommerce-site

## Description

My goal was to build the back-end for the application "e-commrece site" using Express.js API, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

## Installation

1. Use the command line to navigate the directory of the application
2. Clone my repo to your computer: "git clone [insert the repo's link]"
3. Access to the folder: "cd AnnaK-ecommerce-site"
4. Install some necessary packages: "npm install"
5. Make sure you have your psql account and set up DB_NAME:
    DB_NAME = "ecommerce_db"
    DB_USER = "[insert your psql username]"
    DB_PASSWORD = "[insert your psql password]"
6. Seed the database from the command line: "npm run seed"
7. Run the server: "npm start"

## Testing

Test the application's API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Insomnia (see the walkthrough video) 

## Usage

Access the application at http://localhost:3001
