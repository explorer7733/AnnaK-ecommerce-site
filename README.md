# AnnaK-ecommerce-site

## Description

My goal was to build the back-end for the application "e-commrece site" using Express.js API, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

## Installation

1. Use the command line to navigate the directory of the application
2. Clone this project repo to your computer: "git clone [insert the repo's link]"
3. Install the dependcies: "npm install"
4. Install dotenv: "npm i dotenv" 
5. Create database use PostgreSQL shell commands:
    "psql -U postgres"
    "\c ecommerce_db"
    "\i db/schema.sql"
6. When the database is created you need to go out of PostgreSQL shell: "/q"
7. Seed the database from the command line: "npm run seed"
8. Start the application's server: "npm start"

## Testing

Test the application's API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Insomnia (see the walkthrough video) 

## Usage
